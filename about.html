        <h2>
            I’m most often a perfectionist, and I perform pretty well with my work efforts which leads to good grades. I am still working on my time management skills but in the end I still get work done. My ability to problem solve is when there’s a problem, I identify the issue and find ways that work to solve it. I am able to work collaboratively in a group and communicate ideas like in choreographing a dance. I am self-motivated because doing great at work can be rewarding which makes me strive further in interest and goals.
